The purpose of this repo is to setup a basic setup to start developing maya tools on top.
Has the approach of MVC (Model - View - Controller)


### Tech
I'm using Pyside2 for the purpose of this. Alternatively it can be used in conjuction with the Qt wrapper from [mottosso] 

Feel free to improve it. This is for all the tech-artists arround :)
